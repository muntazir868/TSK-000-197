 Use natural language processing techniques to create a concise summary of a
given text document.
 Apply methods like extractive summarization (selecting important sentences) or
abstractive summarization (generating new sentences).
 Utilize techniques such as word frequency, text clustering, or deep learningbased approaches like transformer models (e.g., BART or T5).
 Train or fine-tune the model using large text corpora and evaluate the quality of
summaries produced.
